Here are some features of my website :
 - I scrapped data from amazon and stored it mongodb connected via backend at localhost currently , i made a route in backend to be able to add more data in future. 

- Made some components to render the Login page , Navbar , Homepage , Shopping page and some navigation functionality.

_ the shopping page sends fetch call to get the data from backend in json and display it (made the image to be displayed in a preetier way and the shoe card component is preety decent in looks)

- Used recoil and useffect to send backend call efficiently and manage my state consisitng if data from backend for 1 page i.e 40 items for now.

- Made website little bit prettier with css for now

I am planning to add these option real soon in 1- 2 days :

- User authentication using jsonwebtoken and userinput validation using zod

- Add to cart feature to add and remove

update : 8th march 24

So in 2 days i havnt done much of a visual progress but i was working on tokens,assign the user token and verify it with every further request but still it isnt fully completed, with pressing refresh button the token is getting reset so i have to look for it some more time,

Also in the mean time i added few more buttons like forget password but logic is still missing  there and added buy now and add to cart
